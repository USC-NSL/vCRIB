This document explains how to use the code developed for the system called vCRIB. The description of vCRIB is published in “Scalable rule management for data centers” in NSDI 2013. Note that this system is just developed to test the academic idea of placing networking rules around the network and its implementation can be far from a real-world commercial implementation in terms of coding standards, reliability, and performance. Therefore please use it at your risk. 

Please refer to the following paper if you use the code in any publication:
Masoud Moshref, Minlan Yu, Abhishek Sharma, Ramesh Govindan, "Scalable Rule Management for Data Centers", NSDI, Lombard, 2013
